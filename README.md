LOD data for Wynncraft (for use with [Distant Horizons](https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod)), as a GitHub repository so others can contribute LOD data.

Info on how to use these files is in the [wiki](https://github.com/Wynncraft-Distant-Horizons-Data/lods/wiki/Installation-&-Setting-Up).
